# capix

You will need to create a file `config.py` with the following paths
```python
#Path holding pictures you want to serve
PIC_PATH = "C:\\users\\user\\pictures"
# Path to existing picture database (new database will be created if it doesn't exist).
DB_PATH = "C:\\users\\user\\pictures\\capix.db"
```
